# PDF Photo Generator

## Why
I didn't want to upload documents online to generate a PDF file, and I also wanted to avoid paying subscriptions for programs that I would use infrequently.

## What it does (MVP)
Takes a folder of photos and creates a PDF file from the photos. Each photo takes up a single page, and each page is A4 standardized for regular printing paper.

## Requirements
Images inside the folder `./assets`, numbered like so:
- 01.jpg
- 02.jpg
- ...
- 18.jpg

## Future plans, maybe
- Allow program to work with any number of photos
- Allow naming of PDF file without modifying source code
- Allow program to enumerate through each photo, regardless of photo name convention
- Web interface to allow file upload
  - Organization of photos
  - Download PDF after generation
